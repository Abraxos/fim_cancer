-NOTES-
-The test was ran on an altered version of the architecture as presented in the progress report.
-We now do a split between living and dead cases
-Then run our instance of fim and cgpbfinder, on these two seperate groups. The cgpbfinder will do significance metric test 
--- on living and expressed vs. living and non-expressed. (group_alive)
--- on dead and expressed vs. dead and nonexpressed. (group_dead)
-Doesn't return any sets for group_dead, need to check that... okay. It's happening because that group is very small, 
-need to check different thresholds for two groups.
