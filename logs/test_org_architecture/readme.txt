--NOTES--
-The following test was ran on the reduced table.
-It was ran for threshold 15-30, it returned freq_item sets for 15 to 27... indicating we proubably don't need to search past a thresh of 30.
-A good lower bound is still to be determined.
-For the actual full size table, the result is never gotten as the program never finishes.
